# Project: Algorithms and Flowcharts

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of various algorithms in pseudocode and their corresponding flowcharts. Each algorithm is designed to solve specific problems using fundamental control structures such as conditions, loops, and mathematical operations.

## Contents
This project includes the following exercises:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Determine the largest of two distinct values
**Description:** An algorithm that prompts for two integer numbers and determines which one is larger.
- **Pseudocode:** Implemented in PSeInt.
- **Flowchart:** Graphical representation of the comparison logic.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Check if an integer is divisible by 3
**Description:** An algorithm that prompts for an integer number and verifies whether it is divisible by 3 using the modulo operation.
- **Pseudocode:** Implemented in PSeInt.
- **Flowchart:** Representation of the decision-making process.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate all powers of a number from a¬π to a^k
**Description:** The user inputs a base `a` and a maximum exponent `k`. The program calculates all powers of `a` up to `a^k`.
- **Pseudocode:** Implemented in PSeInt.
- **Flowchart:** Representation of the iteration loop.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Calculation of item prices with and without VAT
**Description:** A menu-driven program that allows entering the prices of three items and calculating the total excluding VAT, VAT at 16%, and the total cost including VAT.
- **Pseudocode:** Implemented in PSeInt.
- **Flowchart:** Representation of the calculation process and menu-driven decision-making.

## Requirements
To run and visualize the flowcharts in this project, it is recommended to use:
- **PSeInt** (To execute the pseudocode).
- **Graphviz** (To generate flowcharts in Python).

## Installation
### üìå Installation on Kali Linux using APT
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install graphviz python3-graphviz -y
python3 python_grafico.py
```

### üìå Installation using pip3 on any Linux distribution
If you prefer to use pip3, install Graphviz and its Python library with:
```bash
pip3 install graphviz
```
